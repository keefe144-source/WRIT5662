# Github and Markdown Key Takeaways
==================================
In week 2, we learned more about Markdown and ways to organize types of content such as lists, direct qutoes, and lines of code. These types of organizagion will help build on 
what we learned from our introduction to Github and Markdown from last week. Three ways Markdown can be used in technical writing are creating structure in documents, collaborating 
with software developers, and converting Markdown to different formats. 

## Creating Structure in Documents

Markdown allows technical writers to create readable documents because of structured writing. The information posted on Canvas and the additional resource for this week provided useful 
tips for creating structure. If I wanted to include blocks of code, I can use the (`) symbol. An example of Python code is below:

```
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        result  *= i
    return result
```

This organization allows for better readability and lets the user distinguid sections of text. Another example of structure are ordered lists. It is interesting that on the markdownguide.org
website, they say that the numbers do not have to be in numerical order. The items will still be read starting at one and counting up. Lists also help break up text and allow for better 
readability. Technical writers can use structuring tecchniques to their advantage because they can create readable documents without worrying about messy layouts. 

## Collaborating with Software Developers

Markdown lets technical writers and software developers keep documents in the same location and for easy access to the documents. The documents are stored in the same repository as the 
source code which increases efficiency. Technical writers and software developers can track changes and make suggestions. This makes the enviornment more collaborative which means better 
results. Documents and files have a better chance at staying updated and that technical documents are kept in the loop about changes to a project or code. 


## Converting Markdown to Different Formats

Another way Markdown can be used by technical writers is to convert it into different formats. As seen in the resources for this week, Markdown can be easily converted to HTML. Following 
the basic syntax in Markdown can let a user create documents or sample webpages. Markdown can even be converted to a PDF or as a Word file. This is useful because a technical writer can 
provide the documentation in online and offline formats without the need for rewriting. The original text can be kept in a Markdown file and be updated when needed. 

## Wrap Up

Markdown is extremely useful for technical writers because it is used to create structed documents to effectively collaborate with others and publishing the content. The syntax is not 
hard to learn and it is intetionally designed that way so writers and developers can use it. It is useful when exporting it as an HTML file for websites or PDF for publishing.
